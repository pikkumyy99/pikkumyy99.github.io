							<p>My very own  on-going game project. The game is just another version of popular game called "Overcooked". The main goal of this project is for me to both develop and grow as a game developer. I want to widen my skill repertoire, especially the coding side. So far has been a really fun and enjoyable journey ♡ </p>
							

							<h2>Louhi 2020</h2>
							<h3>Tool: Aseprite</h3>

							<p>The second school game project. This project was made together in a group of 5 people, where I was in charge of 2D assets with another person. Louhi is 2D top-down point&click game and the development time was around 2 months. Unfortunately the project never finished because of the scale of game and the time constraints, but overall it was really educating journey about teamwork and game design.</p>

							<p>My first ever game project made for school course: 3D endless runner. During the development I only owned 5 years old ready-to-retire laptop and because of that the development process was tedious at times. 
								The project consists of ready made assets and materials which I then combined inside Unity. Coding was done by myself and I created the music using AI music software AIVA which I then edited in Audacity to make it more "static". This project was my first everything in journey of game development, and I think that can be seen. </p>
